===================================
Linear regression in two dimensions
===================================

In this example, we try to predict the median price of houses in Boston's
neighbors by looking at two features: the average of the number of rooms per
dwelling and the pencentage of low status in the population.
The linear regression is done using the `Boston Housing Dataset`_ which
contains 13 features used to predict the median price of houses.
The two features selected are the most efficent on the test set.
The 3D representation allows a better understanding of the prediction
mechanism with two features.

This example is inspired by linear regression example from
`scikit-learn documentation`_.
