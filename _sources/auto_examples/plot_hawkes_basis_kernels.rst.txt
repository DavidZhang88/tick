=========================
Fit exotic Hawkes kernels
=========================

This learner assumes Hawkes kernels are linear combinations of a given number
of kernel basis.

Here it is run on a an exotic data set generated with mixtures of two cosinus
functions. We observe that we can correctly retrieve the kernels and the two
cosinus basis functions which have generated the kernels. This experiment
is run on toy datasets in the `original paper`_.

It could have been more precise if end_time or kernel_size was increased.
