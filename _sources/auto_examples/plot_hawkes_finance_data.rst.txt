Fit Hawkes on finance data
==========================

This example fit hawkes kernels on finance data provided by `tick-datasets`_. 
repository.

Kernels norms of a Hawkes process fit on finance data of Bund market place.
This reproduces experiments run in

Bacry, E., Jaisson, T. and Muzy, J.F., 2016. Estimation of slowly decreasing
Hawkes kernels: application to high-frequency order book dynamics.

with  :math:`P_u` (resp. :math:`P_d`) counts the number of upward (resp.
downward) mid-price moves and :math:`T_A` (resp. :math:`T_b`) counts the
number of market  orders at the ask (resp. bid) that do not move the price.
We observe expected  behavior with for example mid-price moving downward
triggering (resp. preventing) market orders at the ask (resp. at the bid).
