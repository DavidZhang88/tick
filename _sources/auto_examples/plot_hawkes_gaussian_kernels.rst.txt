======================================
Fit Hawkes with asynchronous causality
======================================

This Hawkes (`tick.inference.HawkesSumGaussians`) algorithm assume 
that kernels are parametrized as a sum of gaussians. This can be useful to 
determine whether an action will have an effect in a not so near future. For 
example if you watch a TV show today you might be stimulated to watch the same 
TV show one week later.

I has been originally described in this paper:

Xu, Farajtabar, and Zha (2016, June) in ICML,
`Learning Granger Causality for Hawkes Processes`_.
