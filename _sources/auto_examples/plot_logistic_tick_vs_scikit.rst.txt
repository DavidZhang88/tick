================================================================
Logistic regression comparison: ``scikit-learn`` versus ``tick``
================================================================

In this example we give a naive comparison of ``tick`` and ``scikit-learn`` for
binary classification using logistic regression with :math:`\ell_1`
penalization.
This comparison is done using the well-known ``adult`` dataset, a standard
benchmark dataset for binary clasification.
Some remarks are the following:

* Both classifiers have the same performance in terms of AUC (area under the
  ROC curve)
* Learned model-weights are slightly different. This is explained by the fact
  that ``scikit-learn`` uses ``liblinear`` for optimization of the
  :math:`\ell_1`-penalized likelihood. When using this solver, the
  ``intercept`` is penalized like the model weights (``coeff_``), while this is
  not the case in `tick`. Note that this difference can be reduced by tuning the
  ``intercept_scaling`` parameter from ``scikit-learn``'s
  ``LogisticRegression``
* In this example, the computational time of ``tick`` is better than ``scikit``'s
