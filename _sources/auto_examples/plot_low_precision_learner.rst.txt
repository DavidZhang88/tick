===========================
Precision vs speed tradeoff
===========================

In this example we compare the convergence speed of our learners given the
float precision used.

In both case the convergence speed in term of number of iterations
(on the left) is similar up to float 32 precision.
But compared to the running time (on the right), we can see that using
float 32 instead of float 64 leads to faster convergence up to
float 32 precision.
